# Complex-Switch-Case-and-If-else-code

This code is the solution to the question assigned to me in my 4th Programming Fundamentals Lab during the first semester of my BS in Computer Science. We were required to use only switch-case and if-else statements. This question greatly helped us develop a deeper understanding of selection statements in programming.


Q3. Using IF and Switch statement, write a program that displays the following menu for the food items
available to take order from the customer:
a. B= Burger (Rs. 200)
b. F= French Fries (Rs. 50)
c. P= Pizza (Rs. 500)
d. S= Sandwiches (Rs. 150)
The costumer can order any combination of available food. The program first asks to enter the no of
types of snacks i.e. 1 or 2, then it ask to enter the choice i.e. B for Burger and then for quantity. The
program should finally display the total charges for the order.
